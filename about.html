            <p>Jaxson and Sophie make me so happy! I don't have any children of my own so, I am so glad they are a part of my life.</p>

            <p>I've done some research and found some articles about the life of being an aunt. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/terripous/flipped-aunt-uncle" target="_blank">16 Foolproof Ways To Be The Cool Aunt or Uncle You've Always Wanted To Be</a>. I watch all the TV shows they like. Jaxson likes to play Lego and video games. They are still young, but I can't wait for the day to take them on vacation. Maybe to the beach, go camping, or go to a concert? I love being silly with them, making faces, and especially when we dance around. I want to encourage them to be the best they can be.</p>

            <p>This article from A Cup of Jo <a href="https://cupofjo.com/2019/08/how-to-be-a-great-aunt/" target="_blank">On Being a Great Aunt  </a>gave me some excellent advice on how to be a good aunt when we don't live close together. I love to FaceTime with them. I try to visit as often as I can. And when I do, I take presents!! I think that may be a reason they get so excited for me to come. lol But I do not care. I just want to see the smiles on their faces. A really great quote I found from this article is:</p>

            <figure class="quote">
                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p class="block-quote">There is something in the relationship between aunts and their nephews and nieces that is quite unlike any other. In the company of their aunts, nephews and nieces know that they are privileged persons. The bonds of duty are somehow relaxed: they have no obligations but to be happy.</p> <cite><p>-Robert Lynd</p></cite>

            <p>My kiddos bring a joy to my life that I have never known! I'm so happy for the change that they have made in me. <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/things-that-i-learned-from-being-first-time-aunt-706734e7a022" target="_blank">Things That I Learned From Being a First Time Aunt</a> is a blog I found that talks about the amazing changes that children can bring to your life. I definately have more patients these days.</p>

            <p>Jaxson and Sopie, Aunt DD loves you!!</p>
